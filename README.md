# Alphabet to Number Converter

## Convert words' characters into their position in the alphabet.

You usually pick your PIN Code based on something that means something to you.
Except, you almost always think about a date or a series of numbers.

What if instead you think of your favorite name, food or expression and turn that into your next PIN Code on your phone or your bank account?

I've been doing that for forever now. I think it's a fun way to remember your PIN Code without remembering a date.

Use the tool to:
- Get your new PIN Code based on the words you input,
- Select a number character limit for the returned PIN (some services require 6-digit PIN codes and some other 8 or more),
- See some examples to get you inspired,
- Copy the suggested PIN based on your words with a button
